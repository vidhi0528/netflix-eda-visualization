# Netflix Content Insights Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a detailed *visual analysis of Netflix content*, including movies and TV shows, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.
The goal is to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in Netflix's global content library to support data-driven content decisions.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes the following key insights:

- Total number of titles, movies, and TV shows
- Unique countries producing content
- Content added over time
- Top 5 genres and genre distribution
- Top 5 content-producing countries
- Rating breakdown (TV-MA, TV-14, etc.)
- Movie vs TV show split

Filters:  
Users can filter content by:
- *Release Year*
- *Type (Movie/TV Show)*
- *Country*
- *Genre*

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Performed

Before building the dashboard, the following 10 EDA and preprocessing steps were conducted within Power BI:

1. *Column Profiling* – Analyzed structure and types of each column  
2. *Dealing with Missing Values* – Identified and handled blank/null entries  
3. *Encoding Nulls* – Replaced nulls with meaningful placeholders  
4. *Imputing Missing Values* – Filled missing values based on logic  
5. *Date Cleaning* – Standardized and formatted dates  
6. *Added New Columns* – Derived new insights from existing fields  
7. *Split/Extract Data* – Split fields like cast, country, etc.  
8. *Extracted First Items* – Extracted primary country, genre, etc.  
9. *Text / Sentiment Analysis* – Basic textual insight from descriptions  
10. *Filtered Irrelevant Data* – Removed unnecessary rows and columns
